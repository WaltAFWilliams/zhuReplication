Model replication from Zhu et al. (Original paper can be found here: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(20)30107-2/fulltext)


The paper was featured in the Lancet as a computer vision model with tremendous results on ECG data. In the paper they expressed AUC's, sensitivities, and specificities higher than a team of trained doctors with over 20 years of experience. As a result I aimed to replicate their model (with slight adjustments) and train it on a dataset of ECG data that was found at physionet.org.
